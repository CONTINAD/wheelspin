# The Wheel requires a Node.js server and cannot run on Netlify
# Deploy to Railway, Render, or Fly.io instead

# For Railway.app:
# 1. Go to https://railway.app
# 2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# 3. Select CONTINAD/wheelspin
# 4. Add environment variables:
#    - CREATOR_PRIVATE_KEY (your wallet key)
#    - RPC_ENDPOINT (your Helius RPC)  
#    - TOKEN_MINT (your token address)
# 5. Railway will auto-deploy!
